# KuwagataDLL-C++

## What is this?
This is a rewrite the backend of a C# project I published on GitHub in 2022, *Kuwagata*, in C++. I've also given some of the code a facelift, decreased the sizes of some functions, and rewritten some out-right. I plan to continue to improve this project over time, in order to make Kuwagata (and any other projects dependent on this DLL) faster and more memory-efficient. 

## Why do this?
I plan to port this functionality to OBS Studio out-right as a plugin later on. Rewriting the core functionality in an unmanaged language like C++ also allows me to develop more streaming client specific plugins later on, while consolidating core functionality in one project. 

## What if I want to contribute?
Contributions are welcome! I plan to include a style doc for them later on, but as of now, I welcome any and all code help, because I, admittedly, know a lot less about C++ than I should.
